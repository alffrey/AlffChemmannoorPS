    <h3>Work History</h3>
    <h4>Manager Technology - Publicis Sapient</h4>
    <p>
        A client operating in the niche market of storage solutions and closet works approached us with 
        the need for a digital business transformation. A new mobile Point of Sale solution to be deployed 
        in the stores was one of the asks.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Alffrey led the solutioning effort by first understanding the lay of the land both from a 
            technical perspective as well as visiting the stores to gather their inputs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alffrey designed a solution which can be deployed on the existing tech stack (Docker Swarm) 
            as well as on any Cloud Platforms with minimal changes. He led the delivery team to implement 
            the solution within a short period of 3 months to pilot in 6 stores.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the 90 days since the solution was piloted in 6 stores, the solution has already racked up 
            transactions worth 1 million USD. The Associates and Customers love the new simplified checkout 
            experience showing an increase of 10% in average order value.
        </li>
        <li>
            Within an year of the pilot, we were able to rollout the solution to all 95 stores. We developed 
            a hybrid native app using the existing PWA solution and integrated a new payment reader device 
            which is truly mobile.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Net sales have crossed $10 Million (as of Dec 1, 2022), Average Order Value is 24% higher than regular 
        register orders, Units Per Transaction is 30% higher
